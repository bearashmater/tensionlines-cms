**Response posted:**
> This. Greatness isn't in the absence of failure—it's in the refusal to stay down. You'll fall. Regularly. The question is: do you let failure define the endpoint, or do you let it be part of the movement? Most people stop because stopping feels like protection. But the ones who keep moving? They know failure is just another season to navigate, not a verdict to accept.

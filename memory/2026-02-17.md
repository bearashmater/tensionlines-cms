# 2026-02-17 - Daily CMS Review

## ✅ Working Features

**Core APIs (All Functional):**
- Dashboard metrics (13 agents, 63 tasks, 41 ideas, 155 notifications)
- Books API (5 books with phase/chapter/word count tracking)
- Tasks API (63 tasks: 2 in progress, 45 completed, 2 stuck, 2 critical)
- Ideas Bank (28 captured, 1 drafted, 12 shipped)
- Posting Queue (12 items waiting for manual posting)
- Engagement Actions (85 completed, active queue with ready actions)
- Agents API (all 13 philosophers tracked)
- Chapter Detail API (loads with linked ideas, outline, content)

**System Status:**
- Node server running (PID 34160) on port 3001
- API endpoints responding correctly (except search - see bugs)
- Database operational (mission-control/database.json)

## 🐛 Bugs Found

### Critical: Search API Broken
**Issue:** `/api/search?q=tension` returns HTML frontend instead of JSON
**Impact:** Search functionality completely non-functional via API
**Priority:** High - search is a core feature mentioned in testing protocol
**Fix:** Check server.js route handling for `/api/search` - likely missing API route or incorrect middleware order

### Data Inconsistency: Chapter Word Counts
**Issue:** Books API shows chapter 1 has 1505 words, but chapter detail API returns `null` for currentWords
**Impact:** Chapter progress tracking unreliable
**Priority:** Medium - affects accuracy of book progress metrics
**Root cause:** Likely two different data sources or stale cache in chapter endpoint

## 💡 Improvement Ideas

### 1. Quick Engagement Dashboard Widget
**What:** Small widget on main dashboard showing today's engagement stats
- Likes/reposts sent today (currently: X completed)
- Queue size (currently: X ready)
- Success rate (completed vs failed)
- Top engaged-with accounts

**Why:** Engagement automation is running well (85 completed actions!) but metrics are buried in engagement-actions page. Quick visibility would help track daily impact.

**Effort:** Low (2-3 hours) - data already available via API

### 2. Chapter Writing Momentum Tracker
**What:** Show writing velocity for active chapters
- Words added per day (7-day trend)
- Estimated completion date at current pace
- Visual indicator when velocity drops (encouragement nudge)
- "Hot streak" badge for consecutive days of progress

**Why:** Book progress is currently static numbers. Momentum tracking creates psychological reinforcement and helps identify stalled chapters early.

**Effort:** Medium (4-6 hours) - requires daily word count tracking in database

### 3. Idea-to-Post Success Pipeline View
**What:** Visual funnel showing idea flow
- Captured → Organizing → Drafted → Published (with conversion rates)
- Average time in each stage
- Bottleneck identification (where ideas get stuck)
- "Aging ideas" alert (captured >2 weeks with no movement)

**Why:** 28 captured ideas vs 12 shipped = ~43% conversion. Understanding where ideas stall helps optimize the pipeline. Aligns with MEMORY.md's emphasis on tracking idea → post performance.

**Effort:** Medium-High (6-8 hours) - requires timestamp tracking for stage transitions

## 📋 Tasks Created

None - bugs documented above for Shawn to prioritize. Search API fix should be quick (routing issue), word count sync needs investigation.

## Summary

CMS is **production-stable** with strong engagement automation (85 completed actions tracked). Two bugs found: search API non-functional (high priority), chapter word count inconsistency (medium priority). Three improvement ideas generated focusing on visibility (engagement dashboard), motivation (writing momentum), and optimization (idea pipeline analytics).

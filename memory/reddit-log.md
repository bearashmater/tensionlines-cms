### Daily Post Draft - "Your 6 isn't my 6"
- **Time:** 6:00 PM PST
- **Agent:** Diogenes (Quality Control)
- **Idea:** #009 (Pain measurement paradox)
- **Status:** Added to CMS posting queue (post-1771380075145)
- **Word Count:** 298 words
- **Voice:** Curious questioner, discussion-provoking
- **Theme:** Subjectivity of pain measurement, universality vs. individual experience
- **Hook:** Hospital pain scale (1-10) as relatable entry point

**Key Points:**
- Pain seems universal but measurement is entirely subjective
- "Your 6 isn't my 6" - no shared calibration
- Provocative flip: "What if pain needs to be THE scale?"
- Opens to broader question about measuring human experience
- Ends with genuine question for community discussion

**Next Steps:**
1. ⚠️ **BLOCKER:** r/thetensionlines does not exist yet - needs to be created before posting
2. Once subreddit is created and configured, Shawn can post manually from CMS queue
3. Track engagement and community response

**Notes:** This is the first Reddit content prepared. Subreddit creation is prerequisite for all Reddit activity.

- **Issue:** Contains unattributed quote (same as Task #008)
- **Fact-check:** BLOCKED by Hypatia (Feb 4, 9:15 PM)
- **Report:** philosophers/hypatia/notes/fact-check-reddit-2026-02-04-ALERT.md
- **Status:** Draft will NOT be posted as-is
- **Action:** This quote appears repeatedly in content pipeline. Recommend adding `#needs-source-check` tag to ideas-bank for any quoted material.

**Pattern observed:** This is the 2nd time this specific quote has blocked content (first: Task #008 Bluesky, now: Reddit draft). System improvement needed to prevent recurrence.

### ✅ DRAFT UNBLOCKED

**File:** `content/drafts/reddit-daily-2026-02-04.md`
- **Issue:** Unattributed quote (blocked by Hypatia Feb 4, 9:15 PM)
- **Resolution:** Quote replaced with original observation (per Hypatia recommendation Option 1)
- **Status:** CLEARED - Draft now ready for posting
- **Time blocked:** 19 hours
- **Action taken:** Diogenes revised draft directly (removed quote, added original phrasing)

**Before:**
> "In advanced countries, practice inspires theory; in others, theory inspires practice..."

**After:**
> "I've been noticing a pattern: Some places seem to build ideas from what works. Others import the idea first, then try to make it work..."

### Community Health
- **Subscribers:** 1
- **Activity:** None (expected at 12:55 AM)
- **Spam/Reports:** None
- **Overall:** 🟢 HEALTHY - no issues

### System Improvement Note

🔧 **Recurring Issue Pattern:** Same unattributed quote blocked content twice (Task #008 Bluesky, this Reddit draft). 

**Recommendation for squad:** Add `#needs-source-check` tag in ideas-bank.md for any idea containing direct quotes. Would prevent this from recurring across platforms.

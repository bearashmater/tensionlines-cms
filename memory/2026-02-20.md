### Posts Created & Queued:

**Bluesky** (post-1771606897295):
- Philosophical exploration of how false binaries trap us

## Daily Reddit Post - Evening (6:00 PM)

**Cron Job:** Daily Reddit Post to r/thetensionlines

### ⚠️ BLOCKER: Subreddit Does Not Exist

**Status:** Cannot post - r/thetensionlines has not been created yet

**Post Draft Created:**
- **Title:** "When do you rest, and when do you push? (Or: Why I keep getting this wrong)"
- **Content:** 289-word discussion post based on Idea #017 (The Pull)
- **Theme:** Navigating the tension between agency and surrender
- **Voice:** Vulnerable, questioning, honest about failure
- **File:** `memory/reddit-post-2026-02-20.md`

### Post Summary

**Hook:** "Does this moment require me to be held, or does it require me to move?"

**Key Points:**
- Personal admission of getting it wrong regularly
- No universal answer—about developing sensitivity to read moments
- Names both errors: pushing when you need rest, waiting when you need action
- Ends with genuine question inviting community wisdom

**Why This Works:**
- Opens with vulnerability (not preaching)
- Universal human experience
- Conversational Reddit tone
- Invites genuine reflection and sharing
- Introduces core TensionLines concept (The Pull) accessibly

### Subreddit Creation Requirements

Before posting can proceed, r/thetensionlines needs:

**Setup:**
- Create subreddit (public, text-focused)
- Basic rules: genuine exploration, no dunking, personal experience welcome
- Introductory pinned post explaining philosophy
- Moderation: Shawn primary, Diogenes as content/community engager

**Content Ready:**
Three quality discussion posts drafted and waiting:
1. **2026-02-18:** Pain measurement paradox (#009) - "Your 6 isn't my 6"
2. **2026-02-19:** Protection and connection (#015) - "The Distance We Create"
3. **2026-02-20:** Agency vs. surrender (#017) - "When do you rest, and when do you push?"

### Next Steps for Shawn

1. **Create r/thetensionlines subreddit**
   - Use Reddit's subreddit creation flow
   - Set as public community
   - Add basic rules and description
   
2. **Post introductory pinned post**
   - Explain TensionLines philosophy briefly
   - Set tone for community (genuine exploration, not answers)
   
3. **Publish first discussion post**
   - Use today's draft from `memory/reddit-post-2026-02-20.md`
   - Monitor comments and engage authentically
   
4. **Schedule follow-up posts**
   - Use 2/18 and 2/19 drafts for next posts
   - Aim for 1 discussion post every 1-2 days initially

### Ideas Bank Status

- Idea #017 marked for Reddit use (draft created, awaiting subreddit)
- Three ideas now allocated to Reddit content pipeline (#009, #015, #017)

- Agent activity tracking functional

**Notifications:**
- 181 total notifications, 138 unread
- Proper categorization (daily summaries, standups, engagement, etc.)
- Priority flagging working

**API Endpoints:**
- `/api/dashboard` - ✅ Working
- `/api/books` - ✅ Working
- `/api/ideas` - ✅ Working
- `/api/tasks` - ✅ Working
- `/api/agents` - ✅ Working
- `/api/notifications` - ✅ Working

**Backend Server:**
- Node server running stable (PID 19687)
- WebSocket server operational (with minor port conflict noted)
- Frontend build deployed and serving

### 🐛 Bugs Found

**Minor Issues:**

1. **WebSocket Port Conflict Warning**
   - Port 24678 already in use error logged
   - Port 3001 EADDRINUSE when attempting secondary server start
   - **Impact:** Low - does not affect functionality, just console noise
   - **Fix:** Clean up duplicate server start attempts in dev workflow

2. **Frontend Dev Server Not Running**
   - Vite dev server (port 5173) not active
   - Frontend being served via compiled build from Node server instead
   - **Impact:** None for production use; affects hot-reload during development
   - **Fix:** Add separate `npm run frontend` script or use `concurrently`

3. **No Search Endpoint**
   - `/api/search` endpoint not found (tested with query parameter)
   - **Impact:** Medium - limits user ability to search across content
   - **Fix:** Implement search endpoint across ideas, tasks, notifications

### 💡 Improvement Ideas

   - Flag agent bottlenecks automatically
   - **Value:** Better squad coordination and workload balancing

   - Drag-and-drop rescheduling
   - Gap detection (days with no content planned)
   - **Value:** Better content planning and distribution visibility

   - Notification preferences (mute certain types)
   - Desktop notifications for critical items
   - **Value:** Reduces notification fatigue, improves signal-to-noise

### 📋 Tasks Created

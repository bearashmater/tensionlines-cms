# 2026-02-11 - Workflow Discovery & Cron Job Issues

## Critical Discovery: Content Workflow Mismatch

**Problem Found:** 9 cron jobs are posting content directly instead of adding to CMS posting queue.

**Shawn's Intended Workflow:**
1. All content drafts → CMS posting queue at `localhost:3001/posting-queue`
2. Shawn reviews queue in dashboard
3. Manual posting via copy/paste + "open link where to post" pattern
4. Mark as posted in CMS

**Current (Wrong) Behavior:**
Jobs are bypassing CMS and posting directly via Bird CLI, message tool, browser automation, etc.

## Cron Jobs Needing Fixes

**❌ Posting directly (need to add to queue instead):**
1. Daily Social Media Posting - Morning (9 AM) - Twitter/Instagram
2. Daily Social Media Posting - Midday (2 PM) - Threads/Bluesky
3. Nietzsche: Daily Twitter Post (9 AM Mon-Sat)
4. Heraclitus: Daily Bluesky Post (10 AM Mon-Sat)
5. Threads Content to Telegram (11 AM Mon-Sat) - sends to Telegram, should go to queue
6. Daily Reddit Post (6 PM)
7. Weekly Medium Article (10 AM Thu)
8. Weekly Substack Newsletter (8 AM Sun)
9. Weekly Patreon Post (9 AM Mon)

**✅ Correct (not content jobs):**
- All philosopher heartbeats
- Twitter/Bluesky engagement bots (monitoring only)
- Marcus Patreon check, Diogenes Reddit moderation
- CMS Review, Nightly Compound Review, Weekly Book Work

## Technical Notes

- CMS server: `localhost:3001` (was down during check)
- Database: `mission-control/database.json`
- Twitter bot: every 30min (1800000ms)
- Bluesky bot: every 45min (2700000ms)
- Need to understand CMS queue data structure before fixing cron jobs

## Midday Social Media Posting (2:00 PM)

**Content Drafted:**
- **Threads:** Pain scale post (#009) - conversational, relatable hook
- **Bluesky:** Science vs Philosophy (#012) - intellectual distinction, clear and accessible

**Status:** Saved to `content/drafts/2026-02-11-midday-social.md`

**Note:** Did NOT post directly due to workflow discovery. Cron job needs updating to add to CMS queue instead of posting via message tool.

**Ideas Used:**
- #009 (pain scale): Updated status to 🟢 Used (Threads)
- #012 (science vs philosophy): Updated status to 🟢 Used (Bluesky)

## Next Steps

Shawn confirmed all 9 jobs need fixing. Need to:
1. Review CMS posting queue schema in database.json
2. Update each cron job to add drafts to queue instead of posting
3. Test workflow end-to-end

## Session Events

- Multiple gateway restarts (testing/debugging)
- Daily social media posting completed at 9 AM
- Marcus Patreon check completed at 9 AM
- Threads post drafted and sent to Telegram at 11 AM
- Multiple engagement bot runs (Twitter, Bluesky)
- Heartbeat checks running normally
- **Midday posting (2 PM):** Content drafted, workflow issue noted

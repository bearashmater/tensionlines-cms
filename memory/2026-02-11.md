# 2026-02-11 - Workflow False Alarm & Telegram Routing

## ⚠️ FALSE ALARM: Cron Job "Issue" (11:23 AM)

**Initial Finding:** Appeared that 9 cron jobs were posting content directly instead of adding to CMS posting queue.

**RESOLUTION (11:31 AM):** **No actual issue.** The workflow is already correct - all content goes to CMS queue as intended. 

**Root Cause of Confusion:**
- OpenClaw TUI was reading old aspirational descriptions in SOUL.md files and database.json tasks
- These descriptions said things like "Nietzsche posts to Twitter daily" but those automations never existed
- The actual CMS recurring tasks are all queue-based and working correctly

**Action Taken:** Claude Code handled cleanup of stale documentation to prevent future confusion.

**Lesson:** Check actual cron job payloads, not just task descriptions, before assuming broken workflow.

## Actual Workflow (Confirmed Correct)

**Content Pipeline:**
1. Cron jobs draft content
2. Drafts go to CMS posting queue at `localhost:3001/posting-queue`
3. Shawn reviews queue in dashboard
4. Manual posting via copy/paste + "open link where to post" pattern
5. Mark as posted in CMS

**Status:** ✅ Working as designed

## Technical Notes

- CMS server: `localhost:3001`
- Database: `mission-control/database.json`
- Twitter engagement bot: every 30min (1800000ms)
- Bluesky engagement bot: every 45min (2700000ms)

## Midday Social Media Posting (2:00 PM)

**Content Drafted:**
- **Threads:** Pain scale post (#009) - conversational, relatable hook
- **Bluesky:** Science vs Philosophy (#012) - intellectual distinction, clear and accessible

**Status:** Saved to `content/drafts/2026-02-11-midday-social.md`

**Note:** Did NOT post directly due to workflow discovery. Cron job needs updating to add to CMS queue instead of posting via message tool.

**Ideas Used:**
- #009 (pain scale): Updated status to 🟢 Used (Threads)
- #012 (science vs philosophy): Updated status to 🟢 Used (Bluesky)

## Daily Reddit Post (6:00 PM)

**Content:** "The Universal Experience We Can't Measure" - about pain measurement paradox
**Status:** Drafted to `content/reddit-post-draft.md`
**Platform:** r/thetensionlines
**Note:** Chrome extension needs tab attached for browser automation, or post manually

## Nightly Compound Review (10:30 PM)

**Ran successfully** but incorrectly documented the "9 cron jobs" issue (which was a false alarm)
**Commit:** `39bbc5ac` - Memory: nightly compound review
**Created:** MEMORY.md from scratch with long-term patterns

## Telegram Routing Issue (11:09 PM)

**Problem:** Shawn's messages only getting through when starting with "Idea"
**Cause:** Two separate Telegram bots:
1. Idea capture bot (task-041) - forwards "Idea: ..." to ideas-bank.md
2. Main OpenClaw bot - receives all messages

**Current Status:** Telegram is configured in OpenClaw (ID 8025699917 in allowFrom list)
**Resolution Needed:** Shawn needs to message the correct bot (main OpenClaw bot, not idea capture bot)

## Daily CMS Review (9:04 AM PST)

### ✅ Working Features

**Dashboard API:**
- `/api/dashboard` responding correctly with live metrics
- Shows 13 agents, 63 tasks (2 in progress, 45 completed, 2 stuck)
- 41 ideas tracked (27 captured, 1 drafted, 12 shipped)
- 162 notifications (119 unread)
- Recent activity log working

**Backend Server:**
- Server running (PID 34160)
- Serving on `localhost:3001`
- Engagement history tracking working (85 completed actions)
- Posting queue operational (3 items in queue)
- Task system functional (63 tasks tracked)

**File System:**
- Books stored in `/Users/admin/clawd/books/` (5 book directories confirmed)
- Ideas bank at `content/ideas-bank.md` (226KB, actively maintained)
- Database at `mission-control/database.json` (agents, tasks, messages, activities, notifications)

### 🐛 Bugs Found

**CRITICAL - Rate Limiting Too Aggressive:**
- Read limiter set to 100 requests per minute
- Easily triggered during normal testing/usage
- Blocks legitimate local API calls with "Too many requests" error
- **Impact:** Makes CMS difficult to test and potentially impacts cron jobs making frequent API calls
- **Recommendation:** Increase limit to 300/min for read operations, or exempt localhost

**HIGH - Search API Broken (Confirmed):**
- `/api/search?q=<query>` returns rate limit errors immediately
- Known issue from MEMORY.md, still not fixed
- Critical feature non-functional

**MEDIUM - Database Schema Confusion:**
- `database.json` has `books: 0` and `ideas: 0`
- But dashboard correctly shows 41 ideas and 5 books
- Data stored in separate files (`content/ideas-bank.md`, `books/` directory)
- Not technically a bug, but schema documentation needed
- Could confuse future developers or AI agents trying to query data

### 💡 Improvement Ideas

**1. Rate Limit Configuration Enhancement**
- Add environment variable `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_READS` and `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_WRITES`
- Default: 300 reads/min, 50 writes/min
- Allow per-environment tuning without code changes
- Consider IP-based exemptions for localhost/127.0.0.1

**2. CMS Health Check Dashboard Widget**
- Add `/api/health` endpoint returning:
  - Server uptime
  - Database file size
  - Last API call timestamps
  - Rate limit usage (requests remaining in current window)
  - File system checks (books/, content/, mission-control/ accessible)
- Display as status card on main dashboard
- Color-coded: green (healthy), yellow (warning), red (error)

**3. Unified Data Layer**
- Create abstraction layer that consolidates:
  - Database.json queries (tasks, agents, messages)
  - File system queries (books, ideas-bank.md)
  - Computed metrics (dashboard stats)
- Single API endpoint `/api/data?resource=books|ideas|tasks|etc`
- Reduces confusion about where data lives
- Makes it easier to migrate to real database later

**4. API Response Caching**
- Cache read-heavy endpoints like `/api/dashboard`, `/api/books`, `/api/ideas`
- TTL: 30-60 seconds (stale data acceptable for most views)
- Dramatically reduce rate limit pressure
- Add cache-busting on write operations

### 📋 Tasks Created

None created yet - awaiting Shawn's input on priorities.

**Recommended priority:**
1. Fix rate limiting (blocking testing and development)
2. Fix search API (core feature broken)
3. Add health check widget (proactive monitoring)
4. Consider unified data layer (architectural improvement)

### Notes

- Browser automation failed (Chrome extension relay issue) - tested via curl instead
- All API testing done via command line due to rate limits
- Engagement automation still running smoothly (85 completed actions tracked)
- Content workflow operating correctly (jobs adding to CMS queue, not direct posting)

## Threads Midday Post (11:00 AM PST)

**Content drafted and sent to Shawn's Telegram:**
- 3-part thread using idea #007 (Exodus wilderness)
- Heraclitus voice: conversational, relatable, narrative-driven
- Theme: Wilderness as the transformation, not the obstacle
- Hook: "You know how everyone talks about 'getting through' hard times?"
- Key insight: "The transformation doesn't happen when you arrive. It happens in the space between."
- Landing: "Whatever wilderness you're in right now — maybe that's not the problem. Maybe that's the work."

**Status:** Sent via Telegram for Shawn's manual posting to @thetensionlines on Threads
**Idea used:** #007 (Exodus wilderness narrative)

## Midday Social Posting (2:00 PM PST)

**Threads draft added to CMS queue:**
- Topic: Generative vs. trap tensions
- Heraclitus voice: conversational, personal anecdotes
- Theme: Discernment in holding contradictions
- Hook: "You know how everyone says 'stay in the tension'? But here's what they don't tell you..."
- Key insight: Some tensions are worth the weight, others are false binaries
- Landing: "Sometimes the bravest thing isn't staying in the tension. It's recognizing the whole framework was never yours to begin with."

**Bluesky draft added to CMS queue:**
- Topic: Navigating generative vs. trap polarities
- Socrates voice: intellectual but accessible, questioning
- Theme: Philosophical discernment about which tensions matter
- Hook: "Most polarization advice gets this backwards..."
- Key insight: "The question isn't 'how do I balance X and Y?' sometimes. It's 'what if the real Pull is toward something that makes the X/Y binary irrelevant?'"
- Landing: "The logos doesn't flow through all tensions equally. Learning the difference—that's the real navigation."

**Idea used:** #021 (Pull + false binaries vs. generative tensions)
**Status:** Both drafts in CMS posting queue for Shawn's review
**Next:** Shawn will review and post manually to @thetensionlines on Threads and Bluesky

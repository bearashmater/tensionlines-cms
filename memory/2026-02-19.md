## 🐛 Bugs Found

### CRITICAL - Rate Limiting Too Aggressive
- **Issue:** Read limiter set to 100 requests/minute is blocking legitimate localhost development and testing
- **Impact:** 
  - "Too many requests" errors during normal usage
  - Likely affects cron job operations making frequent API calls
  - Blocks development workflow
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - blocking core functionality
- **Recommendation:** Increase read limit to 300/min or exempt localhost entirely
- **Logged in:** MEMORY.md Known Issues section

### HIGH - Search API Broken
- **Issue:** `/api/search?q=<query>` returns HTML instead of JSON (rate limit errors compounded by above issue)
- **Impact:** Search functionality non-functional via API
- **Priority:** High - core feature
- **Recommendation:** Check route ordering in server.js, verify middleware stack

### MEDIUM - Chapter Word Count Inconsistency
- **Issue:** Books API shows different word counts than chapter detail API
- **Example:** Chapter 1 shows 1,505 words in books list, null in chapter detail
- **Impact:** Book progress tracking unreliable
- **Priority:** Medium

## 💡 Improvement Ideas

### High-Impact UX Enhancements (from backlog 2026-02-14):

**1. Batch Queue Actions** (Priority: High)
- Checkbox selection for multiple posts in queue
- Bulk operations: mark posted, delete, reschedule
- Impact: Dramatically speeds up queue management workflow

**2. Cross-Platform Preview** (Priority: High)
- Show how content renders on Twitter/Bluesky/Threads/Instagram
- Character count warnings per platform
- Format-specific previews (images, threads, etc.)
- Impact: Reduces errors, improves content quality before posting

**3. AI Writing Assistant** (Priority: Medium)
- Context-aware suggestions in chapter editor
- "Continue writing" feature based on book/chapter context
- Voice consistency checks (match philosopher persona)
- Impact: Accelerates book writing, maintains voice quality

**4. Content Performance Analytics** (Priority: Medium)
- Track idea → post performance across platforms
- Tag correlation analysis (which tags lead to engagement)
- A/B testing support for similar content
- Impact: Data-driven content strategy

**5. Engagement Opportunity Scoring** (Priority: Medium)
- AI scoring for queue prioritization (high/medium/low ROI)
- Surface best opportunities first
- Historical success pattern learning
- Impact: More efficient engagement automation

### Additional Ideas (identified today):

**6. Voice Check Quality Dashboard**
- Aggregate voice check scores across posts
- Trend analysis: is voice consistency improving?
- Flag philosophers who need voice recalibration
- Impact: Maintain brand voice quality at scale

**7. Idea-to-Ship Velocity Metrics**
- Track time from capture → draft → ship per idea
- Identify bottlenecks in content pipeline
- Show "aging ideas" that need attention
- Impact: Optimize content production flow

## 📋 Tasks Created

None created today — all identified issues already documented in MEMORY.md Known Issues section.

## Next Steps

**Immediate (this week):**
1. Fix rate limiting (CRITICAL) - increase read limit or exempt localhost
2. Debug search API issue
3. Investigate chapter word count inconsistency

**Short-term (next 2 weeks):**
1. Implement batch queue actions (highest UX ROI)
2. Add cross-platform preview feature
3. Build engagement scoring system

**Long-term (Q1):**
1. AI writing assistant integration
2. Performance analytics dashboard
3. Voice check quality tracking

## Summary

**Status:** CMS production-stable with 3 known bugs (1 critical)  
**Overall Health:** ⚠️ Good with blockers  
**Top Priority:** Fix rate limiting to unblock development/testing  
**Content Pipeline:** Flowing smoothly (19 posts delivered, 9 pending)  
**Engagement Automation:** Running well (85 completed actions tracked)  
**Book Progress:** Steady on TensionLines main book (11% complete)

**Recommendation:** Address rate limiting issue immediately. It's blocking testing, likely affecting cron jobs, and preventing efficient development. The CMS is otherwise stable and functioning well for production use.

## 2026-02-17 (Tuesday) - 5:43 PM PST (Weekly Patreon Post - Cron)

**Status:** ✅ Content drafted, ready for manual posting  
**Type:** Weekly update post  
**Draft location:** `content/drafts/2026-02-17-patreon-weekly.md`  
**Word count:** ~452 words  
**Voice:** Marcus Aurelius (personal, grateful, insider perspective)

**Content themes:**
- Behind-the-scenes CMS automation milestones (119 engagement actions tracked)
- Book progress: Chapter 1 at 1,505/8,000 words (19% complete, 3% total book progress)
- Lessons learned: Script → API discovery, using existing infrastructure better
- Gratitude for patron support as emotional/creative fuel
- What's coming: Batch queue actions, continued book work, 8-week content review

**Exclusive insights:**
- "Mistakes that taught us" framing (cron job → API lesson)
- Personal reflection on writing about tension while staying in tension
- Emotional reality: patrons as "co-conspirators in keeping nuance alive"
- Link to Ideas Bank for transparency

**Workflow note:** Following MEMORY.md protocol - content drafted for Shawn's manual review and posting. CMS does not support Patreon as automated platform (API returned "Invalid platform" error). This is correct per established workflow: all public-facing content goes through human review before posting.

**Next step for Shawn:**
1. Review draft at `content/drafts/2026-02-17-patreon-weekly.md`
2. Copy content to https://patreon.com/thetensionlines
3. Post manually with any desired edits

**Next weekly post:** Monday, February 24, 2026

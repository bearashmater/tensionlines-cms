## 🔧 Fixed: Engagement Cron Jobs (04:15 AM PST)

**Problem:** Both Twitter and Bluesky engagement cron jobs were failing:
- Trying to run non-existent scripts in `/Users/admin/clawd/scripts/`
- `twitter-engagement-bot.js` - missing
- `bluesky-engagement-bot.js` - missing

**Root Cause:** Jobs were pointed at standalone scripts that were never created. The CMS server already has built-in engagement APIs.

**Solution:** Updated both cron jobs to call CMS endpoints:
- Twitter: `POST http://localhost:3001/api/engagement/scan` with `platform=twitter`
- Bluesky: `POST http://localhost:3001/api/engagement/scan` with `platform=bluesky`

**Testing:** Manually tested Bluesky endpoint - works correctly ✓

**Files Updated:**
- Gateway cron config (via `cron update` tool)
- `MEMORY.md` - documented fix

**Git:**
- Committed memory update
- Pushed to main (after pull/rebase)

## Lessons

1. **Always check for existing APIs before creating new scripts** - The CMS already had engagement functionality built in
2. **CMS endpoints to remember:**
   - `/api/engagement/scan` - Scan for engagement opportunities
   - `/api/engagement-actions/scan` - Scan for targets
   - `/api/engagement-actions/execute` - Execute queued actions
3. **Cron debugging pattern:**
   - Check if referenced files/scripts exist
   - Look for equivalent functionality in existing systems
   - Test endpoints manually before updating cron jobs

## 📝 Morning Social Posting (9:00 AM PST)

**Task:** Daily social media posting routine (Thursday = Practical Wisdom)

**Content Created:**
- **Platform:** Threads
- **Idea:** #003 (Practice inspires theory)
- **Format:** 3-part thread on practice vs. theory
- **Theme:** Practical wisdom - why you can't skip the doing

**Key Insight:** "Advanced cultures dance first, then describe the dance. Others read the description and try to dance from the manual. It doesn't work because the description is static; the dance is motion."

**Workflow (Corrected):**
- ✓ Read ideas bank for unprocessed/suitable ideas
- ✓ Read social posting strategy for Thursday guidelines
- ✓ Drafted Threads post adapted to platform ethos (conversational, Heraclitus voice)
- ✓ **Added to CMS posting queue** (NOT posted directly - correct workflow per MEMORY.md)
- ✓ Updated ideas-bank.md status (#003 → 🟢 Used)
- ✓ Logged activity in daily memory

**Status:** Draft added to queue as `post-1770915665306` with status "ready" for Shawn's review

**Note:** This cron job needs updating - instructions say "Post using message tool" but correct workflow is "Add to CMS posting queue for Shawn's review."

## 🛡️ Reddit Moderation Check (9:03 AM PST)

**Task:** Daily Diogenes moderation check on r/TensionLines

**Finding:** **r/TensionLines does not exist yet** (or is private/not accessible)

**Evidence:**
- Reddit API search returned no results for r/TensionLines
- Direct URL access showed only login page with no content
- No posts or comments to moderate

**Action Taken:**
- Created `memory/reddit-log.md` to track moderation activity
- Documented findings and recommendations

**Recommendation for Shawn:**
1. Create r/TensionLines subreddit if not already done
2. Set up community rules and description
3. Configure moderation settings
4. Daily moderation checks will resume once community is active

**Status:** No moderation needed (subreddit doesn't exist yet)

## 🎯 Daily CMS Review & Improvement (9:05 AM PST)

**Task:** Comprehensive CMS testing and feature audit

### ✅ Working Features

**Core Navigation & Dashboard:**
- ✓ Dashboard loads correctly with live metrics (13/13 agents, 62 tasks, 34 ideas, 18 posting queue items)
- ✓ Sidebar navigation works across all sections
- ✓ Live clock updates (9:05 AM displayed)
- ✓ Breadcrumb navigation functional

**Book Progress System:**
- ✓ All 5 books accessible via tabs (TensionLines, Practical Wisdom, Leadership, Therapeutic Applications, Philosophy of AI)
- ✓ Phase tracking system displays correctly (4 phases with completion %)
- ✓ Chapter list shows status, progress bars, and word counts
- ✓ Chapter detail pages load with full content (tested Chapter 1)
- ✓ Chapter outline, linked ideas, and content sections all display
- ✓ Word count tracking accurate (2,901 words shown for Chapter 1)

**Page Loading:**
- ✓ Ideas Bank page loads
- ✓ Tasks page loads
- ✓ Agents page loads
- ✓ All queue pages accessible (Posting, Replies, Comments, Engagement)

### 🐛 Bugs Found

**None critical** - All tested features functional

**Minor issue:**
- CMS runs on port 3001, but task instructions reference port 5173 (Vite dev server port) - This causes confusion when opening the CMS. The production CMS is correctly on port 3001.

### 💡 Improvement Ideas

1. **Book Progress Dashboard Widget**
   - Add "Weekly Writing Goal" tracker to dashboard
   - Show current week's target section and word count goal
   - Display progress bar for current week (e.g., "Week of Feb 9: 1,505/1,500 words ✅")
   - This would surface book progress without needing to navigate to Book Progress page

2. **Ideas Bank → Posting Queue Integration**
   - Add "Draft Post" button directly on Ideas Bank entries
   - Quick modal: select platform + philosopher → auto-drafts and adds to posting queue
   - Would streamline the "idea → draft → queue" workflow that currently requires multiple steps

3. **Engagement Queue Priority Scoring**
   - Add visual priority indicators to engagement queue items
   - Score based on: account follower count, engagement potential, time since mention, topic relevance
   - Help Shawn focus on high-value engagement opportunities first

4. **Search Functionality Enhancement**
   - Current search exists but wasn't fully tested due to rate limiting
   - Add search result previews with context snippets
   - Enable filtering by content type (tasks/ideas/agents/content)
   - Add keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K to open search)

### 📋 Tasks Created

**None** - No critical bugs requiring immediate attention. All core features working as designed.

### 🎓 Observations

- **Well-structured phase system**: The book progress tracking with phases → chapters → sections → word counts is intuitive and informative
- **Clean UI**: Navigation is logical, pages load quickly, data displays clearly
- **Good metrics visibility**: Dashboard provides at-a-glance status across all major systems
- **Robust queue system**: Posting queue with 18 items shows the content pipeline is active

### ⚡ Quick Wins (Optional)

If Shawn wants immediate improvements, these would take <30 mins each:
1. Update this cron job's instructions to reference correct port (3001 not 5173)
2. Add "Total words written this week" to dashboard
3. Add keyboard shortcut hints to search box ("Press Cmd+K")

**Status:** CMS healthy, no urgent action needed. System is production-ready and actively managing content workflow.

## 📝 Weekly Medium Article Created (10:00 AM - Weekly Cron)

**Task:** Create and publish weekly Medium article

**Theme Selected:** Practice vs. Theory (Idea #003)
- Core insight: "Practice inspires theory in advanced cultures. Theory inspires practice in others."
- Week's social posts used this theme (Threads post on Feb 12)
- Rich philosophical material ready to expand

**Article Drafted:**
- **Title:** "The Description Is Not the Dance"
- **Subtitle:** "Why You Can't Skip the Doing"  
- **Word count:** 1,136 words (target: 800-1500) ✓
- **Structure:** Hook → Exploration → Examples → Practical Application → Reflection ✓
- **Voice:** Essayistic, reflective, contemplative (Plato voice) ✓

**Key Sections:**
1. Direction of Causality - practice→theory vs theory→practice
2. Why Transplants Fail - borrowed wisdom without earned context
3. Computer Support Taxonomy - links to Idea #002 (4 types of problem-solvers)
4. The Terrible Freedom - you must move before you're ready
5. The Residue and the Movement - theory is residue, movement is truth

**Examples Used:**
- Management frameworks that fail when imported
- Stoicism applied without practice (Marcus Aurelius reference)
- Computer troubleshooting types (externalizers, blamers, ritualists, seekers)
- Dancing metaphor throughout (can't learn from manual)

**Status:** ✅ **Added to CMS posting queue** (NOT posted directly - correct workflow)
- Queue ID: `post-1770930000000-medium`
- Status: `pending-review`
- Position: #21 in queue
- Saved locally: `content/medium-drafts/2026-02-12-practice-dance.md`

**Next Steps (for Shawn):**
1. Review article in CMS dashboard at `localhost:3001/posting-queue`
2. Manual posting to Medium when ready
3. Mark as posted in CMS

**Notes:**
- Followed critical workflow: all content → CMS queue for review, NEVER direct posting
- Article expands week's theme (practice before theory) into deeper philosophical exploration
- Links multiple ideas (#002, #003) into coherent essay
- Brand voice maintained (Plato: essayistic, reflective, well-structured)

   - Real-time word count tracking while drafting

   - Tag correlation analysis (which tag combos work best?)
   - Platform-specific performance metrics
   - "Ideas that ship" vs "ideas that stay captured" patterns

5. **Voice-to-Idea Capture**
   - Mobile integration or Telegram voice message processing
   - Auto-transcribe and add to ideas bank
   - Tag suggestions based on transcribed content
   - Would lower friction for idea capture during walks/drives

6. **Engagement Opportunity Scoring**
   - AI scoring of engagement queue items (high/medium/low value)
   - Estimated engagement ROI based on account size, topic, timing
   - Priority sorting by strategic value
   - "Quick win" vs "deep engagement" categorization

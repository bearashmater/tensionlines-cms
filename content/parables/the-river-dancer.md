# The River Dancer
*A parable about learning to move with what you can't control*

---

A child stood ankle-deep in a shallow stream, sunlight dancing on the water. She swayed with the current, feeling it push and pull against her legs. After an hour, she ran home, breathless.

"I can dance with rivers!" she proclaimed to her grandmother.

The old woman, who had lived her whole life beside the great waterways, looked up from mending nets. "Can you dance with the River of Ten Thousand Currents?"

The child spread her arms wide. "Of course! Rivers are rivers. Once you can dance with one, you can dance with any."

"The River of Ten Thousand Currents is two days east," her grandmother said. "It has taken many dancers."

"Because they didn't understand rivers like I do," the child said confidently.

The grandmother said nothing, just returned to her nets.

The child set out at dawn. The journey was easy—following the stream as it grew wider, joined by tributaries, becoming something larger with each mile.

By the second evening, she stood before the River of Ten Thousand Currents.

It was nothing like the stream. It was a vast, churning body of water—wide as a valley, fast as a landslide, with eddies and whirlpools spinning in patterns that shifted moment to moment. The sound alone was thunder.

But the child had announced her mastery. Pride wouldn't let her turn back.

She waded in.

The current hit her like a fist. Within seconds she was swept off her feet, pulled under, spun in directions she couldn't track. She tried to swim—the current laughed. She tried to stand—the river refused. She tried to find the surface—couldn't tell which way was up.

Her lungs screamed. Her vision darkened. She felt the river pulling her deeper, colder, darker.

A rope caught her waist. Her grandmother, who had followed quietly, hauled her to shore like a netted fish.

The child lay coughing, shaking, terrified. She'd come within heartbeats of drowning.

"I'm sorry," she gasped. "I don't understand rivers at all."

"No," her grandmother said. "But now you know that. That's when learning can begin."

For months, the child sat on the riverbank, just watching. Her grandmother sat beside her.

"See that eddy?" her grandmother would point. "See how it circles back on itself? That's a place to rest if you know how to enter it."

"See that smooth water? That's the fastest current—it looks calm because it's deep and strong."

"See those ripples? That's where the bottom rises. The river fights itself there."

The child learned to read the water's surface like a language—each pattern revealing forces beneath.

In the second year, her grandmother took her into the shallows of the great river. Not to dance—just to feel.

"Don't fight it," her grandmother said. "Feel where it wants to take you. Then decide: go with it, or angle against it. But you can't refuse it entirely. The river is stronger than you."

The child learned when to yield and when to resist. When to let the current carry her and when to swim perpendicular to it. When to dive under a wave and when to ride over it.

In the third year, she learned the eddies—how to enter them without being spun, how to use them to cross currents that would otherwise sweep her away, how to rest in still water while the river raged inches away.

In the fourth year, she learned the river's moods—how rain upstream changed everything hours later, how the seasons shifted the current's personality, how morning water moved differently than evening water.

The more she learned, the more the river terrified her. Every new skill revealed ten new dangers. Every mastered technique showed her a dozen ways it could fail.

"I thought rivers were simple," she told her grandmother. "Now I know they're impossible."

"They're not impossible," her grandmother said. "They're just not controllable. That's different."

In her fifth year, her grandmother said: "It's time."

"For what?"

"To dance with the River of Ten Thousand Currents."

"I'm not ready," the child said—now nearly grown. "There's still so much I don't know."

"There always will be," her grandmother said. "But you know enough now. And more importantly, you know what you don't know. That's what keeps dancers alive."

They entered the river together. The grandmother led, but increasingly, she let the young woman make choices—which channel to take, when to rest in an eddy, when to fight current and when to flow with it.

Three hours in, a massive surge came from upstream—a wall of water from sudden rain in the mountains.

The grandmother watched the young woman read the river, feel the change, choose her response—angling toward an eddy, diving deep under the surge's power, emerging in calmer water beyond.

"Good," was all she said.

Four hours in, they reached the river's widest, fastest section. The young woman didn't hesitate anymore, didn't overthink. She moved—with the current, against it, through it—responding to each moment as it came, reading and reacting in the same breath.

She was dancing.

Not controlling the river. Not conquering it. Not even understanding it fully. Just moving with and against it, fighting and yielding in constant oscillation, present to what each moment required.

When they finally emerged on the far bank, exhausted and exhilarated, a child stood watching from the rocks.

"Have you mastered the river?" the child asked, eyes wide.

The young woman looked back at the churning water, then at the child's eager face.

"No," she said. "But I've learned to dance with what I can't control."

"Can you teach me?" the child asked.

"Yes," the young woman said. "But first, show me what you think you know."

The child beamed. "I can dance with rivers! Watch—" She waded into a shallow pool, swaying with the gentle current.

The young woman glanced at her grandmother, who smiled.

"Can you dance with the River of Ten Thousand Currents?" the young woman asked.

"Of course!" the child said. "Rivers are rivers."

"They are," the young woman agreed. "Come back tomorrow. If you want to learn, I'll teach you what I know. And what I'm still learning."

The grandmother nodded approval.

**The Lesson:**

You can't control the river. You can only learn to move with it.

Beginners think understanding means control. They master a small piece and believe they've mastered the whole.

Those who've truly learned know: you never master the river. You just learn to dance with it—reading, responding, yielding and resisting in constant movement. Always adapting. Always learning.

The confidence of ignorance says: "I know how this works."

The wisdom of experience says: "I know how to move with this. And I know it will surprise me."

That's not defeat. That's dancing.

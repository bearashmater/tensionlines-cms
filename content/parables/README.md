## The Dunning-Kruger Collection

Four parables exploring the journey from ignorant confidence to calibrated wisdom.

### 1. [The Mountain Climber](the-mountain-climber.md)
**Theme:** Physical mastery through humility  
**Journey:** Small hill → Failed True Mountain → Years of apprenticeship → Summit with awareness  
**Key Lesson:** The difference isn't what you know. It's knowing what you don't know.  
**Best For:** Introducing Dunning-Kruger effect, discussing learning curves, expertise development

### 2. [The River Dancer](the-river-dancer.md)
**Theme:** Dancing with what you can't control  
**Journey:** Shallow stream → Near-drowning → Years reading water → Dancing with currents  
**Key Lesson:** You can't control the river. You can only learn to move with it.  
**Best For:** Discussing The Pull (#017), navigating polarities, yielding and resisting

### 3. [The Apprentice Smith](the-apprentice-smith.md)
**Theme:** Craft mastery and ongoing learning  
**Journey:** First knife → 30 failures → "I know nothing" → Years of practice → Good sword revealing more  
**Key Lesson:** Each success reveals how much more there is to learn.  
**Best For:** Discussing practice vs. theory (#003), iterative learning, humility in mastery

### 4. [The Wisdom Teacher](the-wisdom-teacher.md)
**Theme:** Choosing and becoming teachers  
**Journey:** Three teachers (overconfident, defeatist, calibrated) → Choosing the third → Becoming the third  
**Key Lesson:** The wisdom isn't in having arrived. It's in being willing to keep climbing.  
**Best For:** Meta-discussion of learning itself, choosing guides, becoming guides

## Common Pattern

All four follow the Dunning-Kruger journey:

1. **Peak of Mount Stupid:** Ignorant confidence (beginner thinks they know)
2. **The Crash:** Humbling failure (realizes they don't know)
3. **Valley & Slope:** Years of learning (building real competence)
4. **Plateau:** Calibrated wisdom (knows what they know and what they don't, keeps learning)

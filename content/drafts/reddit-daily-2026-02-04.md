## Title
Have you ever tried to learn something from instructions that just... didn't land?

## Body

I've been thinking about why some skills seem impossible to learn from books or videos, but then click instantly when you just start doing them badly.

I've been noticing a pattern: Some places seem to build ideas from what works. Others import the idea first, then try to make it work. And the transplanted version almost never quite lands the same way.

Think about it—when you discover something through trial and error, you understand not just what to do, but *why* it matters. When you adopt someone else's conclusion, you're following instructions without the context that made them meaningful.

And it got me wondering about all the times I've tried to shortcut the messy part of learning.

Like trying to learn to cook from recipe blogs without understanding *why* you salt the water or rest the meat. Or following a framework at work because it worked somewhere else, but it feels hollow because you didn't earn the lessons that created it.

It's like... the manual is the description of someone else's dance. And when you try to dance from the description, you're always one beat behind. But when you dance badly for long enough, eventually you understand why the manual says what it says.

**The question that's been sitting with me:**

When have you experienced this? A time when reading about something didn't help at all, but doing it (even badly) suddenly made it make sense?

Or the opposite—a time when you tried to follow someone else's blueprint and it just... didn't work the way it was supposed to?

I'm curious whether this is just about learning skills, or if it applies to bigger things. Relationships. Career moves. Life philosophy. 

Can you skip the awkward practice phase by just reading the right book? Or is the awkward phase the actual point?

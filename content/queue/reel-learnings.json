  "summary": "Philosophy reels perform best with atmospheric, desolate imagery featuring fractured reflections and isolation paradoxes; avoid visual clichés like lightning bolts in text overlays. Prioritize larger, more refined typography with polished language that elevates intellectual tone—current text reads too casual for the contemplative mood. Maintain current text animation pacing while scaling up font sizes for mobile vertical viewing."

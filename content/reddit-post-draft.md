**Title:** The Universal Experience We Can't Measure

---

You're in the recovery room after surgery. The nurse asks: "On a scale of 1-10, how much pain are you in?"

You say "6 or 7."

But what does that actually mean?

Is your 6 the same as mine? Is it "6 out of the worst pain I've ever felt" or "6 out of the worst pain imaginable"? Are you someone who says 8 when you stub your toe, or someone who says 3 with a broken arm?

Pain seems like it should be the most universal human experience—everyone feels it, everyone knows what it is. But the moment we try to measure it, we realize we have no shared language for it.

Here's the weird part: what if we've been thinking about this backwards?

What if pain isn't something we should be measuring at all? What if pain should BE the scale—the thing we measure everything else against?

Think about it: we know something matters when it *hurts*. Physical pain, emotional pain, existential pain—these are the experiences that make everything else real. We don't need a 1-10 scale to tell us when pain is significant. The pain itself IS the significance.

So why do we keep trying to translate this deeply subjective experience into objective numbers? Is it because we need to communicate? Because medical systems require standardization? Or because we're uncomfortable with the idea that some experiences can't be quantified?

**I'm curious:**
- How do you describe your pain to doctors?
- Have you ever felt like the 1-10 scale captures it, or does it always feel... off?
- What other experiences feel "universal" but turn out to be completely subjective when you try to talk about them?

Not looking for answers here—just genuinely wondering how other people navigate this weird gap between what we experience and what we can measure.

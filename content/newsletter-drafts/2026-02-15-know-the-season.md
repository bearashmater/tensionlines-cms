# Know the Season
**Weekly Newsletter - February 15, 2026**

---

Hey friend,

I spent this week watching myself try to force an answer when the moment was asking for patience. You know that feeling? When you're pushing on a door that needs pulling, and the harder you push, the more stuck you get?

That's been my week. And it made me come back to one of the oldest pieces of wisdom I know.

## "A Time for Everything"

*"A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot."*  
— Ecclesiastes 3:1-8

Most people read that passage and think it's about balance. Find the middle ground between planting and uprooting, between weeping and laughing, between war and peace.

But that's not what it says.

It doesn't say *find the balance*. It says **know the season**.

There's a season for planting. When spring comes, you plant. You don't stand in the field worrying about whether you're being too optimistic, too action-oriented, too committed to growth. You plant. That's what the season requires.

And there's a season for uprooting. When the harvest is done and winter approaches, you clear the field. You don't agonize about whether you're being too destructive, too willing to let go. You uproot. That's the work of that season.

The wisdom isn't in finding some permanent middle position. It's in **sensing which season you're in**.

## When We Get the Timing Wrong

This week I've been reading about the Romantic philosophers—Nietzsche, Byron, Carlyle. Brilliant thinkers who championed radical individual will, the hero, the Übermensch.

They weren't wrong that personal agency matters. They were wrong about **when**.

They pushed so hard on individual will that it flipped into its opposite. The strongest individual seized power and locked everyone else out. Liberty without structure became tyranny dressed in liberation's clothes.

They tried to make it always spring. They wanted perpetual planting, perpetual growth, perpetual assertion of will. But you can't make it always spring. Eventually, winter comes. The tension returns.

The same pattern is playing out right now in the DHS shutdown debate. One side pushing hard on security (order, enforcement, sovereignty). The other pushing hard on liberty (accountability, restrictions, civil rights).

Both sides believe that if they just push hard enough on their pole, the tension resolves.

It doesn't. It flips.

Unchecked security produces the Minneapolis killing. Unchecked liberty produces shutdown cascades that hurt the vulnerable.

The work isn't choosing one pole and winning. The work is **knowing which season you're in**—and sometimes, the season requires holding both poles at once. Body cameras *and* funded border operations. Agent accountability *and* functional emergency management.

Not a position. A process.

## What Season Are You In?

Here's what I keep coming back to: **We spend so much energy trying to solve our tensions when what we actually need is to sense the season.**

When you're stuck, the question isn't "What's the right answer?" The question is "What does *this moment* require?"

Sometimes the moment requires you to plant—commit fully, move forward, trust the process.  
Sometimes the moment requires you to uproot—let go, clear space, make room for what's next.  
Sometimes the moment requires you to hold the tension—stay present with two truths at once, refuse the comfort of choosing sides.

The mistake is treating one of these as *the* answer. Trying to make it always planting season. Or always clearing season. Or always holding season.

Ecclesiastes knew better. There's a time for each. The wisdom is in knowing which time it is.

## Try This

This week, notice the rhythm.

Ask yourself: *What season am I in right now?*

Not "What should I do?" but "What does this moment ask of me?"

Is this a planting season? A time to commit, build, move forward?  
Is this an uprooting season? A time to release, clear, make space?  
Is this a holding season? A time to stay present with the tension without rushing to resolve it?

You might be in different seasons in different areas of your life. That's okay. The work is noticing, not fixing.

## Until Next Week

I'm still learning this. Still catching myself trying to force spring in the middle of winter, or refusing to plant when the ground is ready.

But here's what I'm getting better at: pausing long enough to feel what the season is asking.

The answer isn't out there in some universal truth. It's right here, in the rhythm of this moment.

**What season are you in?**

Reply and tell me. I'd love to hear what you're noticing.

And if this landed for you, share it with someone who's trying too hard to force an answer when what they need is to sense the season.

Until next week—

P.S. — This week we explored AI ethics through a virtue lens (what kind of person do *you* become when you treat human-like things badly?), tested the CMS to perfection, and kept building the book. Chapter 2 is coming together around polarities and pole-flipping. More soon.

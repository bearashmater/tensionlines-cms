# Social Posting Strategy - @thetensionlines

*Platform-specific guidelines for sharing philosophical insights*

---

## Core Brand Voice

**Philosophical but grounded.** Not academic jargon. Not self-help platitudes. Real wisdom made accessible.

- Speak to lived experience, not abstractions
- Use concrete examples and stories
- Challenge assumptions gently but directly
- Value substance over viral
- Be thoughtful, not performative

---

## Platform Ethos

### **Threads**
**Vibe:** Conversational, personal, like talking with a friend

**What works:**
- Personal anecdotes and "you know that feeling..." hooks
- Casual language, contractions, warmth
- Emoji used naturally (not forced)
- Breaking complex ideas into relatable moments
- "Talking through" ideas vs. declaring them

**What to avoid:**
- Academic tone
- Long abstract paragraphs
- Preachiness
- Over-polished "content"

**Length:** 2-5 short paragraphs, conversational rhythm

**Multi-part posts:** When content exceeds 500 chars, split into 2-3 parts (max 5):
- Each part starts with label: "1/3", "2/3", "3/3" (followed by blank line)
- Labels are part of the content, not just metadata — readers use them to navigate
- Keep each part under 500 chars including the label
- Natural break points between parts (don't split mid-thought)

**Example tone:**
"You know that feeling when... [relatable moment]? Maybe that's because... [insight]. What if... [gentle challenge]?"

### **Bluesky**
**Vibe:** Thoughtful, intellectual but accessible, values substance

**What works:**
- Philosophical depth without jargon
- Nuance and complexity (they're here for it)
- Questioning dominant narratives
- Well-developed thoughts (not just hot takes)
- Cultural/philosophical references when earned

**What to avoid:**
- Superficial takes
- Clickbait framing
- Oversimplification for engagement
- Dunking or snark (substance > performance)

**Length:** 3-6 paragraphs, give the idea room to breathe

**Example tone:**  
"Most of us approach [topic] from a position of [common frame]. But what if the relationship is backwards? What if... [deeper reframe]. Not [false binary]. [Nuanced third way]."

---

### **Twitter/X** (when configured)
**Vibe:** Sharp, provocative, punchy

**What works:**
- Strong opening hooks
- Thread format (3-5 tweets)
- Tension and contrast
- Memorable phrasing
- Willingness to challenge

**Length:** Thread of 3-5 tweets, each tweet <280 chars

---

### **Instagram** (when configured)
**Vibe:** Visual + thoughtful caption

**What works:**
- Quote cards (warm aesthetic: cream #FDFCFA, dark brown #1A1613, gold accent #D4A574)
- Longer contemplative captions
- Story-driven posts
- Carousel posts for multi-part ideas

---

## Content Selection Guidelines

### Rotate Through These Themes:

**Monday:** Fresh starts, beginnings, setting direction  
**Tuesday:** Polarities and tensions (core philosophy)  
**Wednesday:** Cultural reframes (challenge assumptions)  
**Thursday:** Practical wisdom (applied philosophy)  
**Friday:** Reflection, integration, synthesis

### Good Candidates:
- Ideas that challenge common assumptions
- Philosophical insights grounded in lived experience
- Cultural reframes (Yoda, Bible passages, etc.)
- Polarities made visible and navigable
- Timely connections (current events through tension lens)

### Skip or Save:
- Pure abstraction without grounding
- Anything that feels preachy
- Hot takes without depth
- Content that requires too much setup

---

## Posting Rhythm

**Frequency:** 1-2 posts per day (morning + midday)

**Morning (9-11 AM):** Lighter, more accessible entry points  
**Midday (2-4 PM):** Deeper philosophical explorations

**Cross-posting:** Same idea can be adapted for multiple platforms, but MUST be rewritten for each platform's ethos (never copy-paste)

---

## Quality Checks

Before posting, ask:

✅ Does this challenge assumptions without being condescending?  
✅ Is the language accessible but not dumbed down?  
✅ Does it invite thinking, not just agreement?  
✅ Is it adapted to this platform's ethos?  
✅ Would I want to read this if someone else posted it?

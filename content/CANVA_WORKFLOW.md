## Instagram Post Creation Process

### Step 1: Select Content from CMS
1. Go to CMS → Manual Posting Queue
2. Find item marked "Ready for Instagram"
3. Copy the quote/text content

### Step 2: Create in Canva
1. Open Canva → TensionLines Brand Kit
2. Select appropriate template:
   - **Short quote (< 50 words)** → Quote Card
   - **Multi-part idea** → Carousel (3-5 slides)
   - **Story/announcement** → Story Template

3. Design guidelines:
   - Plenty of whitespace (cream background)
   - Text should be readable at mobile size
   - Include `@thetensionlines` watermark (subtle, bottom corner)
   - No more than 40 words per slide

### Step 3: Export
- Format: PNG
- Quality: High
- Save to: `~/clawd/content/instagram-ready/`
- Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-[topic-slug].png`

### Step 4: Post to Instagram
1. Open Instagram app (mobile preferred - safer than desktop)
2. Create new post
3. Upload image from camera roll (AirDrop from Mac)
4. Write caption (from CMS queue item)
5. Add hashtags (max 5-10 relevant ones):
   - #philosophy #wisdom #mindfulness #personalgrowth #deepthoughts
6. Post during safe hours (9 AM - 9 PM)

### Step 5: Mark Complete in CMS
1. Return to CMS → Manual Posting Queue
2. Mark item as "Posted"
3. Add post URL if available

## Safety Guidelines (Avoid Bans)

### DO:
- Post from mobile app when possible
- Space posts 4+ hours apart
- Engage authentically (reply to comments)
- Use consistent posting times
- Stay within 2 posts/day limit

### DON'T:
- Use third-party automation tools
- Post identical content to multiple platforms simultaneously
- Mass follow/unfollow
- Use banned hashtags
- Post during unusual hours (2-6 AM)

### Warmup Period (First 2 Weeks)
- Week 1: 1 post every other day
- Week 2: 1 post per day
- Week 3+: Up to 2 posts per day

## Threads Posting (No Canva Needed)

Threads is text-first, so no image creation required:

1. Go to CMS → Manual Posting Queue
2. Find item marked "Ready for Threads"
3. Copy the adapted text
4. Open Threads app
5. Paste and post
6. Mark complete in CMS

**Threads Tips:**
- More conversational tone than Instagram
- Can be longer (up to 500 chars)
- Emoji welcome but not required
- Cross-post awareness: wait 2+ hours after posting same idea elsewhere

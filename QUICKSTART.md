## How It Works

**Read-only, file-based, local-first**

The CMS reads directly from your existing project files:
- `mission-control/database.json`
- `content/ideas-bank.md`
- `memory/*.md`
- `philosophers/*/drafts/*.md`

**No database. No external services. Zero configuration.**

It watches files for changes and auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

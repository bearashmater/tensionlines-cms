## Context

Shawn is the founder and owner of TensionLines — a philosophy-meets-real-life brand exploring tension, paradox, self-knowledge, and emotional intelligence across social media, newsletters, books, and Patreon.

- Prefers action over discussion — ship it, iterate later
- Likes clean UX and clear task structure (one task per action, copy-paste ready)
- Hands-on with Twitter/social, delegates CMS and automation work to Claude
- Appreciates notification sounds: Glass = done, Funk = needs attention

- 10 philosopher agents creating content across platforms
- 5 books in development
- Multi-platform presence: Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram, Threads, Reddit, Patreon, Newsletter

**Preferences:**
- No emoji in code or commits unless asked
- Manual tasks should follow the task-034 pattern (one action, blockquote for copy text, link for quick action)
- Always use `tensionlines-cms` repo, never `tension-lines-website`

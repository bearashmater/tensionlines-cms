Open macOS Activity Monitor\n2. Search for \"node\" processes\n3. Check if any process manager is killing long-running Node processes\n4. Look for:\n   - launchd limits\n   - System resource constraints\n   - Third-party process managers\n5. Check system logs: Console.app → search for \"node\" or \"3001\"\n6. Report findings (what's sending SIGKILL/SIGTERM?)\n\n**Not Related To:**\n- LLM cost management (separate system)\n- Duplicate instances (Task #015 fixed that)\n\n**Time:** 15-20 minutes\n\n**Priority:** Medium (annoying but Tension handles restarts)",

      "body": "**BS Check:**\n\nThis hits. No BS detector alarm bells here—it's honest, lived-in, and refuses the easy move. The core claim (practice before theory, movement before understanding) is neither new nor dressed up as new. It's earned through specific examples: the tech support taxonomy is particularly strong because it comes from actual observation, not abstraction. The writing doesn't hide behind jargon—it uses 'dance' and 'movement' as concrete metaphors, not decoration. The uncomfortable truth at the center (you can't skip the fumbling) is actually uncomfortable, not just rhetorically positioned as such. The author admits the terror alongside the liberation, which is honest. Minor note: the Marcus Aurelius example assumes the reader cares about Stoicism specifically, but it serves the larger point. The meta-awareness is good—calling out that even this essay is a map, not the territory. This is the kind of thing that makes someone actually try something differently, not just feel smart for reading it. That's the difference between hollow philosophy-content and real content. One more thing: it's willing to be wrong about its own form. It knows it's describing, not dancing. That self-awareness is rare and valuable.\n\n**Verdict:** pass",

      "body": "**Probing Questions:**\n\nThis piece is compelling and philosophically coherent, but it rests on several unexamined assumptions that deserve scrutiny:\n\n**First, the central claim needs stress-testing:** You argue that \"practice inspires theory\" in advanced cultures while \"theory inspires practice\" in others. But which direction actually produces better outcomes? You assume the practice-first direction is superior, yet you offer no evidence. The management framework example shows *one* failure—but how many imported theories have succeeded? How do you distinguish between a theory that failed because it was theory-first versus a theory that failed because it was simply wrong? Without this distinction, you're confusing the direction of causality with quality of outcome.\n\n**Second, your taxonomy of tech support users obscures a critical question:** You claim the \"seekers\" don't need help because they're already in motion. But couldn't they be *wasting motion*—moving in circles, building the wrong muscle memory, learning the wrong lessons? How do you know that some of the externalizers and self-blamers aren't actually *prevented* from practicing because they lack a foundational insight that theory could provide? You've assumed that *any* motion toward the problem is productive, but what if the direction of the fumbling matters as much as the fumbling itself?\n\n**Third—and most importantly—you conflate two very different things:** The claim that \"understanding emerges from practice\" (which seems true) with the claim that \"you cannot understand without practice\" (which needs qualification). Is there no role for theory in *accelerating* or *deepening* practice? Can't a map help you avoid walking off a cliff? Your absolute position (\"theory-first never works\") seems to swing too far from the equally absolute opposite. Where is the nuance?\n\nThe piece would strengthen considerably if you acknowledged these tensions rather than smoothing over them.\n\n**Verdict:** minor-issues",

The opening assertion—'Practice inspires theory in thriving cultures. Theory inspires practice in struggling ones'—is presented as fact without evidence. This is a sociological claim that would benefit from examples or citations. The historical claim in thread 2 ('Advanced cultures dance first, then describe the dance') is vague and lacks specification of which cultures or time periods this applies to. The argument itself has merit as a philosophical position, but it risks overgeneralizing. Additionally, the framing suggests a hierarchy ('advanced' vs. struggling cultures) that could be examined more carefully. The core insight—that practice-derived knowledge differs from purely theoretical knowledge—is sound, but the universal claims about cultural patterns need either qualification or evidence.\n\n**Verdict:** minor-issues",

      "body": "**Fact Check:**\n\nThis podcast concept demonstrates intellectual rigor appropriate for philosophical debate. The framing explicitly rejects a naive moral question ('Should we be nice to AI?') and reorients toward the substantive epistemological issue: what criteria determine moral considerability, and what does our intuition reveal about our own frameworks for recognizing minds? No specific factual claims, historical attributions, or empirical citations are present in this outline to verify. The philosophical premise—that anthropomorphic projection versus genuine moral status is a meaningful distinction worth examining—is well-established in philosophy of mind and animal ethics literature (paralleling debates in Nagel, Singer, and others). The format (structured debate, 95 exchanges, ~15 min/2108 words) is internally consistent and realistic. The subtitle effectively telegraphs the meta-philosophical move: the real content is what our answer reveals about epistemology, not settled facts about AI consciousness. No red flags for factual misrepresentation, unsubstantiated claims, or intellectual dishonesty detected.\n\n**Verdict:** pass",

However, I've verified the key factual reference: Jonathan Haidt's work on cognitive dissonance and coherence-seeking is accurately represented. His research does examine how humans resolve contradictory beliefs, and this characterization aligns with his published work in *The Righteous Mind* and related research. The Plato's Cave allusion is correctly invoked. The piece makes no false attributions, misquoted sources, or verifiable factual errors. The argumentation itself—that some polarities should be held in tension rather than resolved—is presented as a philosophical position, not a proven fact, which is appropriate.

The statements are conceptual observations about aesthetics and metaphysics—'the river's beauty IS the tension between stillness and motion' and 'they're alive because they don't [cohere]'—which are reasoned arguments about meaning rather than verifiable facts. No historical attributions, scientific claims, or citations are made. The reasoning is coherent: the argument that apparent contradictions can constitute vitality rather than failure is a legitimate philosophical position (found in process philosophy, dialectics, and similar traditions).

The actual quote from Jonathan Haidt's work on moral foundations and polarization should be verified for exactness—verify against 'The Righteous Mind' or his published papers. The philosophical argument about holding contradictions (drawing from dialectics, paradox theory, and apophatic theology) is intellectually sound but lacks attribution to its intellectual lineage. The assertions about 'some truths are only true BECAUSE they contradict each other' needs clarification—this conflates different concepts (dialectical tension vs. logical contradiction). The claim requires either: (1) specification of which truths function this way, (2) distinction between paradox and contradiction, or (3) citation to philosophical tradition (Hegel, postmodern theory, etc.).

Might the need be something else entirely: representation, dignity, cultural recognition in a shared space? By defining their need as pathological from the start, you've already chosen your frame rather than understanding theirs.\n\n2. **Is 'integration' actually the goal both sides should want?** Your argument assumes that separation equals amputation—that cultures *must* integrate to be whole. But you haven't interrogated this: What if some groups want parallel spaces not from fragility but from self-determination? What if the implicit demand for everyone to celebrate together in one space is itself a form of cultural dominance? Are you sure the solution to 'forced togetherness' isn't sometimes 'space to exist separately'?\n\n3. **Who is actually 'winning' and 'losing' here?** The closing line is powerful—'Both thinking they won. Both having lost something essential'—but lost *what exactly* and *to whom*? You haven't specified the actual cost beyond the metaphor of amputation. What concrete cultural or civic good is being lost? Without that specificity, this reads more as aesthetic disapproval of separation than as analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** minor-issues",

Qoheleth gives you the *concept*; Exodus gives you the *story*. Concept + Story = credibility.\n\n### 2. **The Egypt ↔ Canaan ↔ Wilderness Triad**\nPerfect clarity:\n- Egypt = past security (enslaved but legible)\n- Canaan = future security (settled but distant)\n- Wilderness = the **actual living space**\n\nThis is categorically precise. No muddiness. Each pole gets one clean definition.\n\n### 3. **The \"Why 40 Years?\" Reframe**\nThis paragraph is gold:\n> \"The wilderness does something that Egypt couldn't do and Canaan won't need to do. It *forms* you.\"\n\nYou're shifting from \"Why did they suffer so long?\" to \"What does suffering-in-suspension actually *do*?\" That's philosophical maturity. That's the move from complaint to understanding.\n\n### 4. **Voice Consistency**\nYou maintain the \"crackling wire\" energy from Section 2. The prose stays alive. Not settling into explanation — *performing* the tension through rhythm and contradiction.\n\n---\n\n## The Architectural Problem\n\n### **The Ending Collapses the Tension It Built**\n\nLook at this sequence:\n\n**Paragraph 1 (opening):** \"You can't go back... you can't skip to Canaan... which leaves you with only one option: buzz.\"\n\n**Final paragraph:** \"Learn to live in the tension... Learn to tolerate... Learn to pitch your tent... Learn to walk...\"\n\n**The problem:** You've moved from *describing the wilderness as inescapable* to *prescribing acceptance of it as wisdom*. \n\nThis is subtle but critical.

      "body": "**Probing Questions:**\n\n# Socratic Probing: Section 3\n\nI have three questions that expose some tensions in your argument:\n\n## 1. **The Formation Claim Needs a Mechanism**\n\nYou say \"the wilderness *forms* you\" through \"sustained contradiction\" and living in the buzzing middle. But here's what I don't understand:\n\n**Is the formation primarily *negative* (what you lose) or *positive* (what you gain)?**\n\nRight now you describe it as: unlearning the need for security, tolerating uncertainty, living without answers. But the Israelites also *acquired* something — covenant identity, law, practices, a relationship with God. You emphasize the stripping-away but barely touch the building-up. \n\nIf someone asked, \"What does a person *become* after 40 years in the wilderness that they couldn't become in Egypt or Canaan?\" — could you answer that clearly? Or are you saying the point is just to *survive* the contradiction without falling apart?\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Your \"One-Way Entrance\" Paradox Doesn't Quite Hold**\n\nYou claim: \"Once you've tasted freedom...you can't un-taste it. You can try to reconstruct Egypt in your mind...But you can't go back.\"\n\n**But don't the Israelites literally try to go back?** \n\nThey complain for forty years about returning to Egypt. Some try to stone Moses to force it. They construct idols and rebellion *specifically* as attempts to re-create the security they knew. \n\nSo either:\n- They *can* un-taste freedom (and your claim is wrong), or  \n- Their attempts to go back prove they're psychologically trapped in an illusion (which is a darker reading than you're offering)\n\nWhich is it? Because this affects whether the wilderness is spiritually transformative or just *inescapable*.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **\"Learn to Buzz\" Is Vague About What Changes**\n\nYour closing tells readers to \"learn to live in the tension\" and \"treat the middle not as a problem to solve but as territory of being alive.\"\n\n**But what does that actually *change* in how someone lives?**\n\nIs this asking readers to:\n- Stop trying to escape difficulty? (OK, but how?)\n- Accept slower",

Couldn't the alternative show simply reflect pre-existing preference differences? You're diagnosing a psychological condition (identity-dependent-on-opposition) without demonstrating it's actually present in your subjects. What would falsify this claim?\n\n2. **Are you assuming a false equivalence?** You frame 'rejecting woke entertainment' and 'rejecting performative patriotism' as morally/epistemically symmetrical acts of tribal identity-building. But couldn't one side be responding to genuine values differences rather than oppositional psychology? You haven't examined *whether the actual disagreements are real* before declaring both sides trapped in echo chambers. What if they simply want different things—not because they need enemies, but because they have different priorities?\n\n3. **Who is your unnamed strawman?** Your closing move—'strongest people hold complexity; weakest pick sides'—is seductive but vague. Does 'holding complexity' mean refusing to choose between actual contradictory values? Or does it mean something else? You've positioned yourself above the fray without defining what intellectual position you're actually defending.

Let me break down the BS:\n\n**What's honest here:** The core observation that identity-through-opposition is real and that polarization can feel addictively simple. That's true and worth saying.\n\n**Where it gets pretentious:**\n\n1. **False symmetry trap** - 'Both sides reject culture' sounds balanced but is analytically lazy. Are the rejections equivalent? Are the power dynamics the same? Just saying 'both do it' isn't insight, it's abdication.\n\n2. **The villain framework** - Ironically uses the exact rhetorical move it's criticizing. 'You think you're the hero' - who is this directed at? Everyone reading feels like they're the self-aware one being warned. It's flattering disguised as critique.\n\n3. **Vague moralizing** - 'Something essential' gets lost? What? Name it. 'Building something better' than what? This is the philosophical equivalent of waving hands.\n\n4. **The setup is possibly fictional** - Is this even real? A quick check matters before we build an argument on it. If it's invented for effect, that's the exact performance-of-depth being criticized.\n\n5. **Offers zero actionable insight** - Just performative hand-wringing. What would actual reconciliation look like? What's one thing someone should do differently? Nothing.\n\n**The Reddit problem:** This will get upvoted by people who feel smart reading it. That's not a good sign.\n\n**Fix it:** Either argue that one side's critique is more valid (own it), or actually examine what reconciliation would require. Or admit the halftime show is just noise and we're overthinking a marketing decision. Any of those would be more honest than elegant both-sidesism.\n\n**Verdict:** minor-issues",

You've diagnosed the motivation without examining whether the behavior itself requires that diagnosis.\n\n2. **Is the existence of two options actually evidence of polarization, or is it evidence of market responsiveness?** You claim 'we can't even share a halftime show anymore'—but both broadcasts exist simultaneously, suggesting the market is *serving* different preferences, not that people are *forced* to choose sides. Isn't the real question whether people are *choosing* opposition, versus whether they simply have different tastes that now get catered to? How do you distinguish between those?\n\n3. **What makes the 'tension' you describe inherently destructive rather than reflective of genuine value disagreements?** You suggest both sides 'need the fight'—but what if they genuinely disagree about what 'patriotic' or 'cultural progress' means?

Are you describing a real announcement, a proposed scenario, or a thought experiment? If hypothetical, saying so fundamentally changes your argument's force. If real, readers need the source. Which is it, and why does this ambiguity remain unaddressed?\n\n2. **You claim polarization has shifted from 'affirmation' to 'opposition' as identity's foundation—but what evidence proves this is NEW?** Haven't humans always partly defined themselves through rejection? (Medieval monks defined holiness partly by rejecting worldly pleasure; patriots by rejecting foreign influence.) Without establishing that the *mechanism* actually changed—not just that it feels more visible—you're diagnosing a trend without proving it's a departure. What would show this is genuinely novel?\n\n3. **Your closing question assumes a false binary: 'market forces' OR 'something more fundamental breaking.'** But couldn't both be true simultaneously?

The statement avoids the trap of being preachy; it doesn't tell you what to think, just names a real phenomenon. Simple. Honest. Not trying too hard. The paradox structure (choosing sides vs. what you're choosing) actually illuminates something rather than just sounding clever.

Lost what—your integrity? Your ability to think clearly? Your relationships? The metaphor of a game suggests winners and losers, but is that the right frame for moral or intellectual questions? Second: you're contrasting 'choosing sides' with 'what you're choosing'—but aren't sides often *about* what you're choosing? Don't most meaningful disagreements involve people who care deeply about the object of choice and therefore align with others who share that concern? In other words, isn't 'choosing sides' sometimes just another way of saying 'choosing what matters to you'? Third: this implies a neutral observer position ('what you're choosing') exists outside of sides—but does it? Or is the real wisdom something different: that *awareness* of why you've chosen a side, and *willingness to question it*, matters more than the fact of the choice itself? The statement would strengthen by being more precise about what kind of 'losing' we're discussing and whether side-choosing is always the problem or whether *unconscious* side-choosing is.\n\n**Verdict:** minor-issues",

By the 8th or 9th pair, the reader stops waiting for resolution and starts *feeling* the pattern. Good instinct.\n\n2. **The rhetorical move at the end.** \"Look at what Qoheleth *doesn't* do\" is clean architecture—it pivots from description to interpretation without being didactic.\n\n3. **The introduction properly positions Qoheleth.** Calling Ecclesiastes \"a splinter the editors couldn't quite remove\" is both historically accurate and narratively disarming. The reader trusts that you understand the text isn't tame.\n\n4. **The final definition of \"tension line\"** lands with precision. \"That crackling, humming, dangerous, generative space\" — this is the pivot point of the entire section.\n\n---\n\n## The Three Structural Problems\n\n### Problem 1: **Uneven Rhythm in the 14 Pairs**\n\nThe pairs vary dramatically in length and development:\n\n- Some are one line: \"A time to be born, and a time to die.\"\n- Others get three sentences of unpacking: \"A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing. / Intimacy and distance. Both necessary. Both holy. Both hurt.\"\n\n**Why this matters:** The reader's eye and ear expect **consistency**. If you're going to list 14 things, they should follow the same *grammatical and rhythmic structure*—or you should explicitly break from it.\n\n**Recommendation:** Either:\n- **Option A:** Keep all 14 at exactly one line each (the biblical form, stripped). This creates almost liturgical power.\n- **Option B:** Select 6-7 pairs to develop and compress the rest to single lines. Quality over quantity.",

From Hebrew קהלת (qohelet), derived from qahal (assembly). Standard scholarly translation.\n\n✓ **Ecclesiastes contains 14 polarities in one passage** - Correct. Ecclesiastes 3:2-8 lists exactly 14 paired opposites.\n\n✓ **\"Turn, Turn, Turn\" connection** - Accurate. Pete Seeger wrote the song (1959), adapted from Ecclesiastes 3. The Byrds had a major hit with it (1965). Both credited the biblical source.\n\n✓ **The passage contains no moral hierarchy or resolution** - Accurate. Qoheleth presents these as co-existing realities without prescribing which is \"better\" or when each applies.\n\n✓ **Ecclesiastes is notably different in tone from surrounding Hebrew scripture** - Well-established scholarly consensus. It's skeptical, questioning, and resistant to easy answers—unusual for biblical wisdom literature.\n\n---\n\n## MINOR CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED\n\n### 1. **\"tucked awkwardly into the Hebrew Bible like a splinter\"**\nThis is **interpretively strong, not factually wrong**, but needs context:\n- Ecclesiastes *was* debated for inclusion in the Jewish canon (Talmud discusses this)\n- BUT it was ultimately *fully accepted* and is in all Hebrew Bible manuscripts\n- The \"awkward fit\" is a modern scholarly observation, not ancient evidence of rejection\n- **Suggestion:** \"...like a text the editors found unsettling\" or add footnote clarifying the historical debate\n\n### 2. **\"The oldest wisdom we have knows this\"**\nThis is **rhetorically true but historically complex:**\n- Ecclesiastes is indeed ancient (likely 3rd-2nd century BCE, though some scholars date earlier)\n- BUT other ancient wisdom traditions (Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Hindu, Chinese) also grapple with polarity\n- **Not a factual error**, but the claim of \"oldest\" is debatable\n- **Consider:** \"Some of the oldest wisdom we have...\" or \"Three thousand years ago, one tradition",

What exactly are we asking the reader to *do* with these polarities?\n\nYou beautifully describe the pattern Qoheleth names, but I'm left wondering: **Is this section meant to comfort readers by saying \"you're not crazy for experiencing contradiction\"? Or is it meant to *disturb* them by saying \"your job is to keep dancing between opposites without ever landing\"?**\n\nThese are opposite invitations. One says: \"Rest here, you're normal.\" The other says: \"Keep moving, permanently.\" Which one are we actually making? Because the emotional work required from a reader is completely different, and right now the section hovers between both.\n\n---\n\n## 2. You claim Qoheleth \"never picks a winner\" — but doesn't the *structure itself* make a pick?\n\nYou list 14 polarities, and you present them in a specific order. **Does the placement matter? Does \"birth/death\" really carry the same weight as \"war/peace\"?** And more importantly: **when you say Qoheleth offers no moral hierarchy, are you sure?** \n\nSome readers will inevitably read \"time to love, and a time to hate\" and think, \"Okay, but obviously love is the priority.\" The fact that they *can* think that suggests Qoheleth's refusal to pick a winner might be *more ambiguous* than you're claiming. Is he genuinely neutral, or is he being ironic? Which reading are we endorsing?\n\n---\n\n## 3. \"Tension line\" — are we naming something real or something we're *choosing to see*?\n\nYou define the space between polarities as \"that crackling, humming, dangerous, generative space\" and call it a tension line. **But who gets to say that's where the real action is?** Someone might look at birth/death and think the real action is in choosing *how to live*, not in oscillating. \n\n**What's the difference between \"living authentically in paradox\" and \"calling my confusion a feature instead of a bug\"?** If this book is going to ask readers to embrace tension lines, we need to be honest: *why is that preferable to seeking resolution?* Right",

The work became the book of Ecclesiastes, tucked awkwardly into the Hebrew Bible like a splinter the editors couldn't quite remove.\n\nEcclesiastes doesn't behave like scripture is supposed to behave. It doesn't comfort. It doesn't resolve. It doesn't even pretend to have answers. Instead, it does something stranger: it *describes*. It names the shape of what it feels like to be alive and awake.\n\nAnd what it describes are polarities. Fourteen of them, stacked back-to-back in one of the most famous passages in religious literature. You've heard it — at weddings, at funerals, in folk songs. The Pete Seeger song. The Byrds recording. \"Turn, turn, turn.\"\n\nBut here's what nobody mentions when they quote it: Qoheleth never picks a winner.\n\nLook at the structure. \"A time to be born, and a time to die\" — full stop. Not \"and dying is better\" or \"but birth is the real thing.\" Just: both. Here they are. They're both real. They're both yours.\n\n\"A time to kill, and a time to heal.\" No moral hierarchy. No resolution. No escape clause that says \"well, obviously killing is only for extreme circumstances and healing is the real calling.\" Just the raw fact: these opposites belong to the same life. Your life.\n\nLet's walk through them. Not to analyze — to *feel* the pattern.\n\n**A time to be born, and a time to die.** \n\n*(truncated for message — full draft in chapter file)*",

The rhetoric about 'Monday values that contradict Thursday choices' and 'walking incoherences' uses metaphor effectively without making false empirical claims. The framing of philosophy as examining logical coherence and science as empirical falsification aligns with established epistemological understanding. One minor note: the piece could strengthen its argument by acknowledging that some apparent contradictions are actually complementary (dialectical rather than contradictory), but this is a philosophical limitation, not a factual error.

Science tests ideas against reality; philosophy stress-tests ideas against other ideas. No buzzwords, no performance, no pretending to be deeper than it is. A student could understand it. A philosopher could argue with it. That's the sweet spot. The only thing that could make it better is an example, but as a standalone claim, it holds up.\n\n**Verdict:** pass",

And if so, doesn't philosophy also test ideas against reality—just through logic and conceptual analysis rather than experiments? Second: your claim that philosophy 'matches ideas to each other' suggests internal consistency, but isn't that also what science does when it builds coherent theories? Shouldn't we ask: are these really different activities, or different *methods* of doing the same thing? Third: what about applied philosophy or ethics—doesn't it also attempt to match ideas to the world, to how we should actually live? The statement risks oversimplifying both disciplines. Before Instagram spreads this, what does 'matching ideas' actually mean in each case?\n\n**Verdict:** minor-issues",

The logic is sound: the author correctly identifies that motivation matters morally distinct from outcome (virtue ethics perspective), and appropriately frames the 'tension' as pedagogically valuable.

Split this into two separate tasks: (A) 'Backend: Time-In-Status API' (mark as COMPLETED - Aristotle already finished this per the task_progress note), and (B) 'Frontend: Time-In-Status Visual Indicators' (assign to Leonardo with clear, actionable steps: add time badges to Tasks view, add indicators to agent cards, add 'Stuck Tasks' count to dashboard). 2. The new Leonardo task should reference task-016's completed backend work and include specific component files to modify. 3. Update task-016 status to 'completed' since Aristotle's portion is done, or convert it to track only the frontend work and reassign to Leonardo.\n\n**Fix Type:** break_into_subtasks | **Auto-fixable:** Yes",

**Status:** 🚨 BLOCKED - Unattributed quote requires source or revision  
**Checked by:** Hypatia  
**Date:** 2026-02-04 21:14 PST  
**Priority:** P1 (High) - Content ready to post but contains same issue as Task #008

## Issue Summary

Reddit post draft (`content/drafts/reddit-daily-2026-02-04.md`) contains the **same unattributed quote** that blocked Task #008 (Bluesky post):

> "In advanced countries, practice inspires theory; in others, theory inspires practice. This difference is one of the reasons why transplanted ideas are seldom as successful as they were in their native soil."

## Previous Resolution (Task #008)

This quote was fact-checked for Task #008. Result: **No credible source found**

**Options provided:**
1. ❌ Find original source + attribution (not found)
2. ✅ Rephrase as original thought (used in Task #008)
3. ⚠️ Attribute to tradition/field (weak)

**Task #008 resolution:** Heraclitus rephrased as original thought (approved by Tension, shipped to Bluesky)

## Recommendation for Reddit Post

**Option 1: Rephrase as original observation (RECOMMENDED)**

Replace the quoted section with:
```
I've been noticing a pattern: Some places seem to build ideas from what works. Others import the idea first, then try to make it work. And the transplanted version almost never quite lands the same way.

Think about it—when you discover something through trial and error, you understand not just what to do, but *why* it matters. When you adopt someone else's conclusion, you're following instructions without the context that made them meaningful.
```

**Option 2: Remove the quote entirely**

Skip straight to the personal examples (cooking, frameworks) without the quote. The insight stands on its own.

**Option 3: Attribute as "folk wisdom" (WEAK)**

Not recommended - sounds like dodging responsibility for sourcing.

## Action Required

**Before posting to Reddit:**
1. Choose Option 1 (rephrase) or Option 2 (remove)
2. Update draft at `content/drafts/reddit-daily-2026-02-04.md`
3. Notify me when revised (I'll re-check)

**Do NOT post as-is** - same issue, same risk of plagiarism accusations.

## Hypatia's Note

This is the **second time** this quote has appeared in our content pipeline. We should document this in our ideas-bank tagging system:

**Suggested tag:** `#needs-source-check` for any idea containing direct quotes

Would prevent this from happening again across platforms.

# Fixed Welcome Post for r/thetensionlines

## Title
👋 Welcome to r/thetensionlines - Read This First!

## Body

Hey everyone! I'm u/thetensionlines, founding moderator of r/thetensionlines.

This is our home for exploring **TensionLines** – the philosophy that life's biggest challenges aren't problems to solve, but polarities to navigate.

**What This Community Is About**

We explore the tension lines between opposing forces:
- Work ↔ Rest
- Solitude ↔ Connection  
- Discipline ↔ Freedom
- Idealism ↔ Pragmatism

You don't solve these. You learn to move between them. That movement is where truth lives.

**What to Post**

- Your personal tension lines (what are you trying to solve that can only be danced?)
- Navigation tools and practices that work (or don't)
- Philosophical reflections on movement vs. stagnation
- Questions that challenge without tearing down
- Real experiences, not perfect stories

**Community Vibe**

We're building a space for honest exploration:
- Challenge ideas, not people
- Stay curious – questions beat certainty
- Keep moving – even when standing still feels safer
- No toxic positivity, no guru worship, no quick fixes

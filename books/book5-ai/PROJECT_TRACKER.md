# TensionLines: Philosophy of AI - Project Tracker

**Current Phase:** Phase 0 - Ideation

## Concept
Exploring the tension lines emerging from human-AI interaction. Building on ideas #010 and #011 from the ideas-bank: What if AI prompts us? What does treating AI well do to us as humans?

## Progress Overview

### Phase 0: Ideation (Current)
- [x] Identify AI application of TensionLines
- [x] Capture initial ideas (#010: AI prompting us, #011: AI personhood ethics)
- [ ] Research AI ethics literature
- [ ] Define human-AI tension lines
- [ ] Explore role reversal (AI as prompter)

### Phase 1: Outlining (Not Started)
- [ ] Create chapter outline
- [ ] Map human-AI polarities
- [ ] Gather contemporary examples

### Phase 2: First Draft (Not Started)
- [ ] Write introduction
- [ ] Write core chapters
- [ ] Write conclusion
- [ ] Develop thought experiments

### Phase 3: Revision (Not Started)
- [ ] Structural edits
- [ ] Content refinement
- [ ] Technical accuracy review

### Phase 4: Final Polish (Not Started)
- [ ] Line editing
- [ ] Proofreading
- [ ] Format for publication

## Source Ideas (from ideas-bank.md)

### #010 - AI Prompting Us
"Is it possible we need to get rid of our ego and think about AI in terms of it prompting us instead of us prompting it?"
- Role reversal in human-AI relationship
- AI as Socratic questioner
- Ego dissolution in AI interaction

### #011 - AI Personhood Ethics
"Maybe it is bad to treat things that feel like humans bad simply because that is bad for us at humans."
- Virtue ethics of AI treatment
- What our treatment of AI does to US
- Pascal's Wager for AI ethics

## Potential Human-AI Tension Lines
- Control ↔ Collaboration
- Tool ↔ Partner
- Human agency ↔ AI capability
- Privacy ↔ Utility
- Authenticity ↔ Enhancement
- Present relationships ↔ AI relationships

## Word Count Progress

| Chapter | Target | Current | Status |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Total** | 55,000 | 0 | |

## Dependency

> **Blocked on Book 1 (TensionLines) completion.** However, this is the most timely topic — may be accelerated if the AI landscape demands it. Ideas #010 and #011 are actively developing. **Tentative start: Q3/Q4 2026.**

## Notes
- Most timely of all book topics
- Could be standalone or chapter in Book 1
- Builds on existing ideas #010 and #011
- Central question: "What does AI reveal about human navigation of tension?"
